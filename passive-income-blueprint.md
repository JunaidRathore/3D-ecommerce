In the next 48 hours, I'll show you exactly how I cut my work week to 15 hours (while doubling my income).

Tomorrow, I'll reveal the #1 AI tool that saved me 10 hours per week instantly.

Talk soon,

**Day 2 - Build Trust** (24 hours later)
Subject: "The $47 tool that replaced my $4,000/month assistant"

```
Remember yesterday when I promised to share my #1 time-saving AI tool?

Here it is: Claude 3 (it's free).

But here's what nobody tells you...

It's not about HAVING the tool. It's about knowing the exact prompts that make it work like magic.

I spent 400+ hours testing different approaches. Want to skip the learning curve?

I've compiled my 50 best prompts into the AI Productivity Vault.

These aren't generic "write me a blog post" prompts...

These are battle-tested, solopreneur-specific automations like:
- The "Client Onboarding Machine" (saves 3 hours per client)
- The "Content Calendar Creator" (plans 30 days in 30 minutes)
- The "Email Response Generator" (inbox zero in 15 min/day)

Tomorrow, I'll share a special offer for action-takers only.
